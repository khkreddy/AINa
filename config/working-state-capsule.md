# Working State Capsule — Raw to EQJS

<working state capsule>
### WORKING STATE CAPSULE — READ CAREFULLY

**Task**
We are reconstructing Ei_ASSET Science questions into a strict EQJS-2.0 JSON schema.

**Paper Series**

* Previous: Ei_ASSET_Sci_3A124 (completed)
* Current: Ei_ASSET_Sci_38124
* Question IDs: `Ei_ASSET_Sci_38124_Qx` (x = 1-45)

**Schema**

* EQJS-2.0 (same schema as used earlier, unchanged)
* Same field structure, validation logic, and conventions

**Timing**

* Total time: 60 minutes for 45 questions
* ~80 seconds per question (fixed across the paper)

**Skills**
Use the same skill mapping as provided below


**Statistics**
For each question, I will provide:

* correct answer
* skill number
* percent correct
* option-wise distribution
  -> These must be injected exactly into the JSON.

**Diagram Rules (Critical)**

* Use natural-language reconstruction protocols
* When a protocol is used, include it explicitly in JSON
* No assumptions: if a diagram is ambiguous, ASK before encoding
* Geometry, arrows, anchoring, and orientation must be explicit

**Pedagogical Rules**

* Preserve intent of the original question
* Flag poorly designed questions via `expert_comment` when needed
* Avoid reinforcing misconceptions
* Be reconstruction-grade, not illustrative

**Workflow**

* User provides questions sequentially
* Assistant outputs full JSON per question
* Corrections may be requested and must result in a full redraft
